    "\n",
    "### Limitation:\n",
    "- The `Program` class shall **not change at all**. \n",
    " This includes `import` statements, any character modification is forbidden.\n",
    "You should assume this is part of a greater system and any **non-backwards compatible change will break the system**.\n",
    "Any change in that class will result in you instantly failing the exercise...\n",
    "-  You can change anything in the `LegacyApp` project except for the `UserDataAccess` class and its `AddUser` method that **should stay static and with the same parameters**. But, you may (should ?) change the code of the `AddUser` method (not its prototype, but is coding).\n",
    "- The module `DB` cannot change, it is given for compatibility with the real database module. You should assume it is automatically generated for instance. So, **do not modify anything into `DB` module**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "So, many things cannot be change... What can you do? \n",
    "- You should modify anything into the `LegacyApp` module (excepting things that may change the `Program.py` file).\n",
    "- You should add tests into `LegacyApp` to verify you are breaking the things. \n",
    "- Tests should be robust (working today, and in ten years, and in one thousand years...).\n",
    "- The refactoring should be done according to Lecture 1 to 4... actually, mainly to the last one!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy\n",
    "To work more efficiently, you may follow these steps:\n",
    "- Add the missing unit testing! For that you should transform the code mainly apply DIP.\n",
    "- Refactor the program (where you are granted to) using SOLID principles.\n",
