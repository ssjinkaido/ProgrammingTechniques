    "# Lecture 4: software architecture principles\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture concerns software development in Python, but also in all programming language by side effet. \n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, we are here concerned by the **good practice** required to write production ready software, or quality software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now you have learned the basics about programming. The goal is now to apply this knowledge and skills for real world code... Well, in our example it will remain small applications, but the principles are valid for real application including the ones for PhD students, for a single developer, or for many ones working together onto the same project for some years. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any kind of application the first question to ask is about its **architecture**. What do we mean by that? The architecture describes the organisation between the different class, different levels corresponding to libraries and functionalities, grouped by topics like logging, UI, etc. An application depending on the context can be built upon micro-services, onto a central bus, using distributed component, or around kernels made as Russian dolls, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the main questions are:\n",
    "- how to test the application (unit test, integration test)?\n",
    "- how to organise the different communication between the objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "While these questions can have different answers, in this lecture we focus on some very **basic principles** that should simplify the coder life, whatever the final chosen architecture is. We start with the *must-be-used-else-you-are-fired* **SOLID** ones (so, five patterns, one per letter), then **DRY** and we conclude by a **KISS**."

    "## Single responsibility principle\n",

    "```quote\n",
    "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another, perhaps more comprehensible definition is:\n",
    "```quote\n",
    "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find different examples of class that breaks this principle. Here the one from wikipedia:\n",
    "```quote\n",
    "As an example, consider a module that compiles and prints a report. Imagine such a module can be changed for two reasons. First, the content of the report could change. Second, the format of the report could change. These two things change for different causes. The single-responsibility principle says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should, therefore, be in separate classes or modules. It would be a bad design to couple two things that change for different reasons at different times.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously here *module* should be understood as *class* or *object*, as this principle is agnostic regarding the used programming language. Let us take another example, in Python this time. "

    "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is quite important to explain here the differences:\n",
    "- A module will be said to be **open if it is still available for extension**. For example, it should be possible to add fields to the data structures it contains, or new elements to the set of functions it performs.\n",
    "- A module will be said to be **closed if it is available for use by other modules**. This assumes that the module has been given a well-defined, stable description (the interface in the sense of information hiding).\n",

    "## Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "This principle was first proposed by Barbary Liskov in 1988.\n",

    "In short it can be summarized by the following rule:\n",

    "How this function is made? \n",

    "```python\n",
    "def len(container) -> int:\n",
    "    return container.__len__()\n",

    "## Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "This principle is very simple and widely used in so many frameworks that it seems to be used even by dinosaurs.\n",
    "It is a fundamental principle for testing, and since testing is absolutely required in any code (your code is ready for trash else), it should be considered as an axiom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) can be stated as follows:\n",
    "```quote\n",
    "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Waouh, so short principle! \n",
    "But, if you take a look on Wikipedia or others pages, you will see very long pages with lot of explanation. \n",
    "We try to stay short here, so we do not add too many extra details. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, DIP states:\n",
    "- High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).\n",
    "- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By dictating that both high-level and low-level objects must depend on the same abstraction, this design principle inverts the way some people may think about object-oriented programming.\n",
    "This is very important way to think about DIP: there are two ways, one from interface to implementation, the other considering only interfaces and barely interface. Of course the second way is the *dark side of coding*, that should be banished, while the first is the *light side of coding*. The first produces code quickly than the second when we start application... but when the application grows, it is more and more difficult to modify it, and should lead in most of the case to application rewriting process. The second side needs to think more before to code, but after the beginning it allows to modify and extend an application quite simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have already use this principle in many different *frameworks* in Java, Python, C++, C#... \n",
    "A **service** is typically the result of the DIP application. Instead of considering the service as a concrete implementation, most of the frameworks propose some abstractions of services. These abstraction are used at different level of the application, and with **dependency injection** (DI) some service providers are added for instance into the configuration layers...\n",

    "    app = App()\n",
    "    app.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Well, normally you should have seen the problem: `App.start()` uses directly the class `FXConverter`.\n",
    "It is not that we use the `converter.convert()` method, but the fact that we build an instance of this class... \n",
    "This should not be done here, since it break the DIP (we depend on the implementation, not onto an abstraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this dark mistake, we must use an interface... \n",

    "from abc import ABC\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class CurrencyConverter(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def convert(self, from_currency, to_currency, amount) -> float:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we may add some implementations:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FXConverter(CurrencyConverter):\n",
    "    def convert(self, from_currency, to_currency, amount) -> float:\n",
    "        print('Converting currency using FX API')\n",
    "        print(f'{amount} {from_currency} = {amount * 1.2} {to_currency}')\n",
    "        return amount * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, DIP can be applied to the `App` class as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class App:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, converter: CurrencyConverter):\n",
    "        self.converter = converter\n",

    "        self.converter.convert('EUR', 'USD', 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you have noticed, the `start()` method does create any instance of converter... The instance is received into the constructor (but it can be received into a setter as well). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling the previous lecture, it is crystal clear that this is mandatory to do correct *unit testing*, as testing the class `App` should be done by mocking all the other class (else, errors into these other classes will probably fail the test of `App`...). "

    "## Test Driven Development\n",
    "Test Driven Development (TDD) is not exactly a coding principle, but more a **coding methodology**. It states the following:\n",
    "- First, writing the unit and integration testing you will do. \n",
    "- Second, the implementing the functionalities you will do. \n",
    "\n",
    "It means that the first step in programming consists to write the test (assuming interface then), before to write the concrete implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology seems crazy for most of the baby programmers, that want to start by the concrete implementation and finish by playing on their phone instead of writing good test...\n",
    "But, let us recall that a code with no test must be stored into `/dev/null`... \n",
    "Test matters more than the concrete implementation, as if your implementation does have test or does not pass the test, then it cannot be included into the rest of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is really the case in production, where the git/svn **continuous integration** pipeline (CI) launches the tests before to accept or reject your push. The acceptation is made using the result of the tests, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "May be you think that a way to pass this is to not write test? \n",
    "Ha, little player you are then :wink: \n",
    "The CI pipeline should not accept your code if no test is provided too! \n",
    "This can be checked using **code coverage**, that corresponding to the ratio between the tested methods on their number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, code coverage assume the tests exist, but not that they are good enough... This is the responsibility of the coder, and this is check when you apply for a job and regularly but TCBCF, i.e. your supervisor (TCBCD for *Test Checker and Bad Coder Firer*)."

    "This principle is not part of SOLID, but is one of the very important principle you have learnt during your bachelor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY) is quite simple to understand actually: it means that your should not write the same piece of code more than once. If it is the case, then you must put it into a function or a class. Following SOLID, this implies to write one or some interfaces if they are missing, and at least one implementation...\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest, this very important principle is very difficult to follow in big application, because to avoid to repeat itself one programmer may need to add some new interface/implementation... But what happens if this already exist? What happens if another coders needs the same at the same time? There are a lot of situation where the DRY principle leads us to misconception, repetition in the application, or simply led us to reinvent the wheel. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this bad consequence, we must think about the application architecture: where the classes will go? Into which module? This is another principle actually, called **Separation of Concerns** (SoC). The same thing at at higher level...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different kind of applications. The most used one consists to the Russian dolls model, with a central kernel providing some basic functionalities, onto which a first layer is added with other functionalities and so on. It is not very efficient for application made by many different programmers, actually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another architecture relies on different vertical layers, where is layer contains some responsibility like UI, inputs, logging, database connexion, and so on. This can be done in the same way with Russian dolls where is layer contains different parts... \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, as you may have understood it the most important is then the documentation about the architecture and the communication between the programmers. With Agile methods, there is a lot of meetings (daily, weekly, start/stop...) to coordinate the different levels of information, and to exchange a lot about what everyone is doing. \n",
