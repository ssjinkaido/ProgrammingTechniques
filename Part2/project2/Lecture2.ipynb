    "## Type Systems\n",
    "All programming languages include some kind of type system that formalizes which categories of objects it can work with and how those categories are treated. For instance, a type system can define a numerical type, with `42` as one example of an object of numerical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic typing\n",
    "**Python is a dynamically typed language**: the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime. The following dummy examples demonstrate that Python has dynamic typing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> if False:\n",
    "...     1 + \"two\"  # This line never runs, so no TypeError is raised\n",
    "... else:\n",
    "...     1 + 2\n",
    "...\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> 1 + \"two\"  # Now this is type checked, and a TypeError is raised\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the first example, the branch `1 + \"two\"` never runs so it’s never type checked. The second example shows that when `1 + \"two\"` is evaluated it raises a `TypeError` since you can’t add an integer and a string in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s see if variables can change type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> thing = \"Hello\"\n",
    ">>> type(thing)\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> thing = 28.1\n",
    ">>> type(thing)\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Python, `type()` returns the type of an object. These examples confirm that the type of thing is allowed to change, and Python correctly infers the type as it changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static typing\n",
    "The opposite of dynamic typing is **static typing**. Static type checks are performed without running the program, generally as your program is compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "With static typing, variables generally are not allowed to change types, although mechanisms for casting a variable to a different type may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a quick example from a statically typed language. Consider the following Java snippet:\n",
    "```Java\n",
    "String thing;\n",
    "thing = \"Hello\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line declares that the variable name thing is bound to the `String` type at compile time. The name can never be rebound to another type. In the second line, thing is assigned a value. It can never be assigned a value that is not a `String` object. For instance, if you were to later say `thing = 28.1f` the compiler would raise an error because of incompatible types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will always remain a dynamically typed language. However, PEP 484 introduced type hints, which make it possible to also do static type checking of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike how types work in most other statically typed languages, type hints by themselves don’t cause Python to enforce types. As the name says, type hints just suggest types. There are other tools, which you’ll see later, that perform static type checking using type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duck typing\n",
    "Another term that is often used when talking about Python is duck typing. This moniker comes from the phrase “if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck” (or any of its variations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing is a concept related to dynamic typing, where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. Using duck typing you do not check types at all. Instead you check for the presence of a given method or attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, you can call `len()` on any Python object that defines a `.__len__()` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class TheHobbit:\n",
    "...     def __len__(self):\n",
    "...         return 95022\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> the_hobbit = TheHobbit()\n",
    ">>> len(the_hobbit)\n",
    "95022\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the call to `len()` gives the return value of the `.__len__()` method. In fact, the implementation of `len()` is essentially equivalent to the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def len(obj):\n",
    "    return obj.__len__()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to call `len(obj)`, the only real constraint on obj is that it must define a `.__len__()` method. Otherwise, the object can be of types as different as `str`, `list`, `dict`, or `TheHobbit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing is somewhat supported when doing static type checking of Python code, using structural subtyping. You’ll learn more about duck typing later."

    "## Hello Types\n",
    "This section presents how to add type hints to a function. \n",
    "The following function displays a hello message using the name given in parameters:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting(name, capitalized=True):\n",
    "    if capitalized:\n",
    "        return 'Hello ' + name\n",
    "    return 'hello ' + name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s time for our first type hints! To add information about types to the function, you simply annotate its arguments and return value as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting(name: str, capitalized: bool=True) -> str:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The text: `str` syntax says that the argument should be of type `str`. Similarly, the optional `capitalized` argument should have type bool with the default value `True`. Finally, the `-> str` notation specifies that the function returns a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of style, PEP 8 recommends the following:\n",
    "- Use normal rules for colons, that is, no space before and one space after a colon: `name: str`.\n",
    "- Use spaces around the `=` sign when combining an argument annotation with a default value: `capitalized: bool = True`.\n",
    "- Use spaces around the `->` arrow: `def headline(...) -> str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding type hints like this has no runtime effect: they are only hints and are not enforced on their own. For instance, if we use a wrong type for the (admittedly badly named) `capitalized` argument, the code still runs without any problems or warnings:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(greeting(\"Marc Antoine\", capitalized=\"yes\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "displays\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Hello Marc Antoine\n",
    "```\n",
    "The reason this seemingly works is that the string `\"yes\"` compares as truthy. Using `capitalized=\"no\"` would not have the desired effect as `\"no\"` is also truthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To catch this kind of error you can use a static type checker. That is, a tool that checks the types of your code without actually running it in the traditional sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might already have such a type checker built into your editor. For instance PyCharm immediately gives you a warning.\n",
    "The most common tool for doing type checking is `mypy` though. You’ll get a short introduction to `mypy` in a moment, while you can learn much more about how it works later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t already have `mypy` on your system, you can install it using `pip`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python -m pip install mypy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Put the following code in a file called greeting.py:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting(name: str, capitalized: bool=True) -> str:\n",
    "    if capitalized:\n",
    "        return 'Hello ' + name\n",
    "    return 'hello ' + name\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greeting('Marc Antoine', capitalized=\"yes\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is essentially the same code you saw earlier: the definition of `greeting()` and one examples that is using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now run `mypy` on this code:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy headlines.py\n",
    "greeting.py:6: error: Argument \"capitalized\" to \"greeting\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"bool\"\n",
    "Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Based on the type hints, `mypy` is able to tell us that we are using the wrong type on line 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix the issue in the code you should change the value of the align argument you are passing in. By doing so, the error raised by `mypy` disappears..."

    "Each card is represented as a tuple of strings denoting the suit and rank. The deck is represented as a list of cards. `create_deck()` creates a regular deck of 52 playing cards, and optionally shuffles the cards. `deal_hands()` deals the deck of cards to four players.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will see how to extend this example into a more interesting game as we move along.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences and Mappings\n",
    "Let’s add type hints to our card game. In other words, let’s annotate the functions `create_deck()`, `deal_hands()`, and `play()`. The first challenge is that you need to annotate composite types like the list used to represent the deck of cards and the tuples used to represent the cards themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "With simple types like `str`, `float`, and `bool`, adding type hints is as easy as using the type itself:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name: str = \"Guido\"\n",
    "pi: float = 3.142\n",
    "centered: bool = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "With composite types, you are allowed to do the same:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names: list = [\"Guido\", \"Jukka\", \"Ivan\"]\n",
    "version: tuple = (3, 7, 1)\n",
    "options: dict = {\"centered\": False, \"capitalize\": True}\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, this does not really tell the full story. What will be the types of `names[2]`, `version[0]`, and `options[\"centered\"]`? In this concrete case you can see that they are `str`, `int`, and `bool`, respectively. However, the type hints themselves give no information about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you should use the special types defined in the typing module. These types add syntax for specifying the types of elements of composite types. You can write the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Dict, List, Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "names: List[str] = [\"Guido\", \"Jukka\", \"Ivan\"]\n",
    "version: Tuple[int, int, int] = (3, 7, 1)\n",
    "options: Dict[str, bool] = {\"centered\": False, \"capitalize\": True}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that each of these types start with a capital letter and that they all use square brackets to define item types:\n",
    "- `names` is a list of strings.\n",
    "- `version` is a 3-tuple consisting of three integers.\n",
    "- `options` is a dictionary mapping strings to `Boolean` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typing module contains many more composite types, including `Counter`, `Deque`, `FrozenSet`, `NamedTuple`, and `Set`. In addition, the module includes other kinds of types that you’ll see in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to the card game. A card is represented by a tuple of two strings. You can write this as `Tuple[str, str]`, so the type of the deck of cards becomes `List[Tuple[str, str]]`. Therefore you can annotate `create_deck()` as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def create_deck(shuffle: bool = False) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Create a new deck of 52 cards\"\"\"\n",
    "    deck = [(s, r) for r in RANKS for s in SUITS]\n",
    "    if shuffle:\n",
    "        random.shuffle(deck)\n",
    "    return deck\n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition to the returned value, you’ve also added the `bool` type to the optional shuffle argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases your functions will expect some kind of sequence, and not really care whether it is a list or a tuple. In these cases you should use `typing.Sequence` when annotating the function argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List, Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(elems: Sequence[float]) -> List[float]:\n",
    "    return [x**2 for x in elems]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using `Sequence` is an example of using duck typing. A `Sequence` is anything that supports `len()` and `.__getitem__()`, independent of its actual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Aliases\n",
    "The type hints might become quite oblique when working with nested types like the deck of cards. You may need to stare at `List[Tuple[str, str]]` a bit before figuring out that it matches our representation of a deck of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider how you would annotate `deal_hands()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def deal_hands(\n",
    "    deck: List[Tuple[str, str]]\n",
    ") -> Tuple[\n",
    "    List[Tuple[str, str]],\n",
    "    List[Tuple[str, str]],\n",
    "    List[Tuple[str, str]],\n",
    "    List[Tuple[str, str]],\n",
    "]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Deal the cards in the deck into four hands\"\"\"\n",
    "    return (deck[0::4], deck[1::4], deck[2::4], deck[3::4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "That’s just terrible!\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that type annotations are regular Python expressions. That means that you can define your own type aliases by assigning them to new variables. You can for instance create `Card`, `Deck` and `Hand` type aliases:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List, Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Card = Tuple[str, str]\n",
    "Deck = List[Card]\n",
    "Round = Tuple[Deck, Deck, Deck, Deck]\n",
    "```\n",
    "`Card` can now be used in type hints or in the definition of new type aliases, like `Deck` and `Hand` in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these aliases, the annotations of `deal_hands()` become much more readable:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def deal_hands(deck: Deck) -> Round:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Deal the cards in the deck into four hands\"\"\"\n",
    "    return (deck[0::4], deck[1::4], deck[2::4], deck[3::4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Type aliases are great for making your code and its intent clearer. At the same time, these aliases can be inspected to see what they represent:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List, Tuple\n",
    "Card = Tuple[str, str]\n",
    "Deck = List[Card]\n",
    "Deck\n",
    "```\n",
    "that will display:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "typing.List[typing.Tuple[str, str]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that when printing `Deck`, it shows that it’s an alias for a list of 2-tuples of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions Without Return Values\n",
    "You may know that functions without an explicit return still return `None`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def play(player_name):\n",
    "     print(f\"{player_name} plays\")\n",
    "ret_val = play(\"Jacob\")\n",
    "print(ret_val)\n",
    "```\n",
    "that will display:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Jacob plays\n",
    "None\n",
    "```\n",
    "While such functions technically return something, that return value is not useful. You should add type hints saying as much by using `None` also as the return type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# play.py\n",
    "def play(player_name: str) -> None:\n",
    "    print(f\"{player_name} plays\")\n",
    "ret_val = play(\"Filip\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The annotations help catch the kinds of subtle bugs where you are trying to use a meaningless return value. `Mypy` will give you a helpful warning:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy play.py\n",
    "play.py:4: error: \"play\" does not return a value\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that being explicit about a function not returning anything is different from not adding a type hint about the return value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# play.py\n",
    "def play(player_name: str):\n",
    "    print(f\"{player_name} plays\")\n",
    "ret_val = play(\"Henrik\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this latter case `mypy` has no information about the return value so it will not generate any warning:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy play.py\n",
    "Success: no issues found in 1 source file\n",
    "```\n",
    "As a more exotic case, note that you can also annotate functions that are never expected to return normally. This is done using `NoReturn`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import NoReturn\n",
    "def black_hole() -> NoReturn:\n",
    "    raise Exception(\"There is no going back ...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since `black_hole()` always raises an exception, it will never return properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Play Some Cards\n",
    "Let’s return to our card game example. In this second version of the game, we deal a hand of cards to each player as before.

    "\n",
    "### The Any Type\n",
    "`choose()` works for both lists of names and lists of cards (and any other sequence for that matter). One way to add type hints for this would be the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "from typing import Any, Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "def choose(items: Sequence[Any]) -> Any:\n",
    "    return random.choice(items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means more or less what it says: items is a sequence that can contain items of any type and `choose()` will return one such item of any type. Unfortunately, this is not that useful. Consider the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# choose.py\n",
    "import random\n",
    "from typing import Any, Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "def choose(items: Sequence[Any]) -> Any:\n",

    "\n",

    "reveal_type(names)\n",
    "\n",
    "name = choose(names)\n",
    "reveal_type(name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "While `mypy` correctly infers that names is a list of strings, that information is lost after the call to `choose()` because of the use of the `Any` type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy choose.py\n",
    "choose.py:10: error: Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str*]'\n",
    "choose.py:13: error: Revealed type is 'Any'\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will see a better way shortly. First though, let’s have a more theoretical look at the Python type system, and the special role `Any` plays."

    "## Type theory\n",
    "This lecture does not cover all the theory underpinning Python type hints. For more details see the PEP 483 and 484. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtypes\n",
    "One important concept is that of subtypes. Formally, we say that a type `T` is a subtype of `U` if the following two conditions hold:\n",
    "- Every value from `T` is also in the set of values of `U` type.\n",
    "- Every function from `U` type is also in the set of functions of `T` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two conditions guarantees that even if type `T` is different from `U`, variables of type `T` can always pretend to be `U`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a concrete example, consider `T = bool` and `U = int`. The `bool` type takes only two values. Usually these are denoted `True` and `False`, but these names are just aliases for the integer values `1` and `0`, respectively:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> int(False)\n",
    "0\n",
    ">>> int(True)\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> True + True\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> issubclass(bool, int)\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since `0` and `1` are both integers, the first condition holds. Above you can see that booleans can be added together, but they can also do anything else integers can. This is the second condition above. In other words, `bool` is a subtype of `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of subtypes is that a subtype can always pretend to be its supertype. For instance, the following code type checks as correct:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def double(number: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return number * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print(double(True))  # Passing in bool instead of int\n",
    "```\n",
    "Subtypes are somewhat related to subclasses. In fact all subclasses corresponds to subtypes, and `bool` is a subtype of `int` because `bool` is a subclass of `int`. However, there are also subtypes that do not correspond to subclasses. For instance `int` is a subtype of `float`, but `int` is not a subclass of `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariant, Contravariant, and Invariant\n",
    "What happens when you use subtypes inside composite types? For instance, is `Tuple[bool]` a subtype of `Tuple[int]`? The answer depends on the composite type, and whether that type is **covariant**, **contravariant**, or **invariant**. This gets technical fast, so let’s just give a few examples:\n",
    "- `Tuple` is *covariant*. This means that *it preserves the type hierarchy of its item types*: `Tuple[bool]` is a subtype of `Tuple[int]` because `bool` is a subtype of `int`.\n",
    "- `List` is *invariant*. *Invariant types give no guarantee about subtypes*. While all values of `List[bool]` are values of `List[int]`, you can append an `int` to `List[int]` and not to `List[bool]`. In other words, the second condition for subtypes does not hold, and `List[bool]` is not a subtype of `List[int]`.\n",
    "- `Callable` is *contravariant* in its arguments. This means that *it reverses the type hierarchy*. You will see how `Callable` works later, but for now think of `Callable[[T], ...]` as a function with its only argument being of type `T`. An example of a `Callable[[int], ...]` is the `double()` function defined above. Being contravariant means that if a function operating on a `bool` is expected, then a function operating on an `int` would be acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you don’t need to keep these expression straight. However, you should be aware that subtypes and composite types may not be simple and intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradual Typing and Consistent Types\n",
    "Earlier we mentioned that Python supports gradual typing, where you can gradually add type hints to your Python code. Gradual typing is essentially made possible by the `Any` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somehow `Any` sits both at the top and at the bottom of the type hierarchy of subtypes. `Any` type behaves as if it is a subtype of `Any`, and `Any` behaves as if it is a subtype of any other type. Looking at the definition of subtypes above this is not really possible. Instead we talk about consistent types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type `T` is consistent with the type `U` if `T` is a subtype of `U` or either `T` or `U` is `Any`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type checker only complains about inconsistent types. The takeaway is therefore that you will never see type errors arising from the `Any` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can use `Any` to explicitly fall back to dynamic typing, describe types that are too complex to describe in the Python type system, or describe items in composite types. For instance, a dictionary with `string` keys that can take any type as its values can be annotated `Dict[str, Any]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do remember, though, if you use `Any` the static type checker will effectively not do any type any checking."

    "A type variable is a special variable that can take on any type, depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a type variable that will effectively encapsulate the behavior of choose():\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Choosable = TypeVar(\"Choosable\")\n",

    "\n",
    "A type variable must be defined using TypeVar from the typing module. When used, a type variable ranges over all possible types and takes the most specific type possible. In the example, name is now a str:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy choose.py\n",
    "choose.py:10: error: Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str*]'\n",
    "choose.py:12: error: Revealed type is 'builtins.str*'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Consider a few other examples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# choose_examples.py\n",
    "from choose import choose\n",
    "\n",
    "reveal_type(choose([\"Guido\", \"Jukka\", \"Ivan\"]))\n",
    "reveal_type(choose([1, 2, 3]))\n",
    "reveal_type(choose([True, 42, 3.14]))\n",
    "reveal_type(choose([\"Python\", 3, 7])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first two examples should have type `str` and `int`, but what about the last two? \n",
    "The individual list items have different types, and in that case the `Choosable` type variable does its best to accommodate:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy choose_examples.py\n",
    "choose_examples.py:4: error: Revealed type is 'builtins.str*'\n",

    "choose_examples.py:6: error: Revealed type is 'builtins.float*'\n",
    "choose_examples.py:7: error: Revealed type is 'builtins.object*'\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you’ve already seen `bool` is a subtype of int, which again is a subtype of `float`. So in the third example the return value of `choose()` is guaranteed to be something that can be thought of as a `float`. In the last example, there is no subtype relationship between `str` and `int`, so the best that can be said about the return value is that it is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that none of these examples raised a type error. Is there a way to tell the type checker that `choose()` should accept both strings and numbers, but not both at the same time?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can constrain type variables by listing the acceptable types thanks to the `TypeVar` typing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# choose.py\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "from typing import Sequence, TypeVar\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosable = TypeVar(\"Choosable\", str, float)\n",

    "reveal_type(choose([\"Python\", 3, 7]))\n",
    "```\n",

    "choose.py:13: error: Value of type variable \"Choosable\" of \"choose\" cannot be \"object\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also note that in the second example the type is considered `float` even though the input list only contains `int` objects. This is because `Choosable` was restricted to strings and floats and `int` is a subtype of `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our card game we want to restrict `choose()` to be used for `str` and `Card`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Choosable = TypeVar(\"Choosable\", str, Card)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Optional Type\n",
    "A common pattern in Python is to use `None` as a default value for an argument. This is usually done either to avoid problems with `mutable` default values or to have a sentinel value flagging special behavior.\n",
    "\n",

    "    \"\"\"Rotate player order so that start goes first\"\"\"\n",
    "    if start is None:\n",
    "        start = choose(names)\n",
    "    start_idx = names.index(start)\n",
    "    return names[start_idx:] + names[:start_idx]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The challenge this creates for type hinting is that in general start should be a string. \n",
    "However, it may also take the special non-string value `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to annotate such arguments you can use the `Optional` type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Sequence, Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "def player_order(\n",
    "    names: Sequence[str], start: Optional[str] = None\n",
    ") -> Sequence[str]:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `Optional` type simply says that a variable either has the type specified or is `None`. An equivalent way of specifying the same would be using the `Union` type: `Union[None, str]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Object(ive) of the Game\n",

    "Now let’s add types to this code.\n",
    "### Type Hints for Methods\n",
    "First of all type hints for methods work much the same as type hints for functions. The only difference is that the self argument need not be annotated, as it always will be a class instance. The types of the `Card` class are easy to add:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Card:\n",
    "    SUITS = \"♠ ♡ ♢ ♣\".split()\n",
    "    RANKS = \"2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A\".split()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, suit: str, rank: str) -> None:\n",
    "        self.suit = suit\n",
    "        self.rank = rank\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self) -> str:\n",
    "        return f\"{self.suit}{self.rank}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the `.__init__()` method always should have `None` as its return type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes as Types\n",
    "There is a correspondence between classes and types. For example, all instances of the `Card` class together form the `Card` type. To use classes as types you simply use the name of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a `Deck` essentially consists of a list of `Card` objects. You can annotate this as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Deck:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, cards: List[Card]) -> None:\n",
    "        self.cards = cards\n",
    "```\n",
    "`Mypy` is able to connect your use of `Card` in the annotation with the definition of the `Card` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn’t work as cleanly though when you need to refer to the class currently being defined. For example, the `Deck.create()` class method returns an object with type `Deck`. However, you can’t simply add `-> Deck` as the `Deck` class is **not yet fully defined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you are allowed to use string literals in annotations. These strings will only be evaluated by the type checker later, and can therefore **contain self and forward references**. The `.create()` method should use such string literals for its types:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Deck:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def create(cls, shuffle: bool = False) -> \"Deck\":\n",
    "        \"\"\"Create a new deck of 52 cards\"\"\"\n",
    "        cards = [Card(s, r) for r in Card.RANKS for s in Card.SUITS]\n",
    "        if shuffle:\n",
    "            random.shuffle(cards)\n",
    "        return cls(cards)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the `Player` class also will reference the `Deck` class. This is however no problem, since `Deck` is defined before `Player`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Player:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name: str, hand: Deck) -> None:\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.hand = hand\n",
    "```\n",
    "Usually annotations are not used at runtime. This has given wings to the idea of postponing the evaluation of annotations. Instead of evaluating annotations as Python expressions and storing their value, the proposal is to store the string representation of the annotation and only evaluate it when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such functionality is planned to become standard in the still mythical Python 4.0. However, in Python 3.7 and later, forward references are available through a `__future__` import:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from __future__ import annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "class Deck:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def create(cls, shuffle: bool = False) -> Deck:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "With the `__future__` import you can use `Deck` instead of `\"Deck\"` even before `Deck` is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning `self` or `cls`\n",
    "As noted, you should typically not annotate the `self` or `cls` arguments. Partly, this is not necessary as `self` points to an instance of the class, so it will have the type of the class. In the `Card` example, `self` has the implicit type `Card`. Also, adding this type explicitly would be cumbersome since the class is not defined yet. You would have to use the string literal syntax, self: `\"Card\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one case where you might want to annotate `self` or `cls`, though. Consider what happens if you have a superclass that other classes inherit from, and which has methods that return `self` or `cls`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# dogs.py\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name: str, birthday: date) -> None:\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.birthday = birthday\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "        return cls(name, date.today())\n",
    "\n",
    "    def twin(self, name: str) -> \"Animal\":\n",
    "        cls = self.__class__\n",
    "        return cls(name, self.birthday)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self) -> None:\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "fido = Dog.newborn(\"Fido\")\n",
    "pluto = fido.twin(\"Pluto\")\n",
    "fido.bark()\n",
    "pluto.bark()\n",
    "```\n",
    "While the code runs without problems, `mypy` will flag a problem:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mypy dogs.py\n",
    "dogs.py:22: error: \"Animal\" has no attribute \"bark\"\n",
    "dogs.py:23: error: \"Animal\" has no attribute \"bark\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The issue is that even though the inherited `Dog.newborn()` and `Dog.twin()` methods will return a `Dog` the annotation says that they return an `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like this you want to be more careful to make sure the annotation is correct. The return type should match the type of `self` or the instance type of `cls`. This can be done using **type variables** that keep track of what is actually passed to `self` and `cls`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# dogs.py\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "from typing import Type, TypeVar\n",
    "\n",
    "TAnimal = TypeVar(\"TAnimal\", bound=\"Animal\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name: str, birthday: date) -> None:\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.birthday = birthday\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def newborn(cls: Type[TAnimal], name: str) -> TAnimal:\n",
    "        return cls(name, date.today())\n",
    "\n",
    "    def twin(self: TAnimal, name: str) -> TAnimal:\n",
    "        cls = self.__class__\n",
    "        return cls(name, self.birthday)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self) -> None:\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "fido = Dog.newborn(\"Fido\")\n",
    "pluto = fido.twin(\"Pluto\")\n",
    "fido.bark()\n",
    "pluto.bark()\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are a few things to note in this example:\n",
    "- The type variable `TAnimal` is used to denote that *return values might be instances of subclasses of `Animal`*.\n",
    "- We specify that `Animal` is an upper bound for `TAnimal`. Specifying bound means that `TAnimal` will only be `Animal` or one of its subclasses. This is needed to properly restrict the types that are allowed.\n",
    "- The `typing.Type[]` construct is the typing equivalent of `type()`. You need it to note that the class method expects a class and returns an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotating *args and **kwargs\n",
    "In the object oriented version of the game, we added the option to name the players on the command line. This is done by listing player names after the name of the program:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python game.py GeirArne Dan Joanna\n",
    "Dan: ♢A   Joanna: ♡9   P1: ♣A   GeirArne: ♣2\n",
    "Dan: ♡A   Joanna: ♡6   P1: ♠4   GeirArne: ♢8\n",
    "Dan: ♢K   Joanna: ♢Q   P1: ♣K   GeirArne: ♠5\n",
    "Dan: ♡2   Joanna: ♡J   P1: ♠7   GeirArne: ♡K\n",
    "Dan: ♢10  Joanna: ♣3   P1: ♢4   GeirArne: ♠8\n",

    "Dan: ♠3   Joanna: ♡5   P1: ♣9   GeirArne: ♠Q\n",
    "Dan: ♠A   Joanna: ♠9   P1: ♠10  GeirArne: ♡8\n",
    "Dan: ♢6   Joanna: ♢5   P1: ♢7   GeirArne: ♣4\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is implemented by unpacking and passing in `sys.argv` to `Game()` when it’s instantiated. The `.__init__()` method uses `*names` to pack the given names into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding type annotations: even though names will be a tuple of strings, you should only annotate the type of each name. In other words, you should use str and not `Tuple[str]`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Game:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, *names: str) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Set up the deck and deal cards to 4 players\"\"\"\n",

    "            n: Player(n, h) for n, h in zip(self.names, deck.deal(4))\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, if you have a function or method accepting `**kwargs`, then you should only annotate the type of each possible keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callables\n",
    "Functions are first-class objects in Python. This means that you can use functions as arguments to other functions. That also means that you need to be able to add type hints representing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions, as well as lambdas, methods and classes, are represented by `typing.Callable`. The types of the arguments and the return value are usually also represented. For instance, `Callable[[A1, A2, A3], Rt]` represents a function with three arguments with types `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`, respectively. The return type of the function is `Rt`.\n",

    "## The typing Module\n",
    "Before to conclude this lecture, let us introduce a survey of all the typing possibilities with the `typing` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `typing` module was introduced in the standard library to add many datatype for static type checking to Python 3.5 as well as older versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It defines the fundamental building blocks for constructing types (e.g. `Any`), types representing generic variants of builtin collections (e.g. `List`), types representing generic collection ABCs (e.g. `Sequence`), and a small collection of convenience definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that special type constructs, such as `Any`, `Union`, and type variables defined using `TypeVar` are only supported in the type annotation context, and `Generic` may only be used as a base class. All of these (except for unparameterized generics) will raise `TypeError` if appear in `isinstance` or `issubclass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental building blocks:\n",
    "- `Any`, used as `def get(key: str) -> Any: ...`.\n",
    "- `Union`, used as `Union[Type1, Type2, Type3]`.\n",
    "- `Callable`, used as `Callable[[Arg1Type, Arg2Type], ReturnType]`.\n",
    "- `Tuple`, used by listing the element types, for example `Tuple[int, int, str]`. The empty tuple can be typed as `Tuple[()]`. Arbitrary-length homogeneous tuples can be expressed using one type and ellipsis, for example `Tuple[int, ...]`. (The `...` here are part of the syntax, a literal ellipsis.)\n",
    "- `TypeVar`, used as `X = TypeVar('X', Type1, Type2, Type3)` or simply `Y = TypeVar('Y')` (see below for more details).\n",
    "- `Generic`, used to create user-defined generic classes.\n",
    "- `Type`, used to annotate class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Generic` variants of builtin collections:\n",
    "- `Dict`, used as `Dict[key_type, value_type]`.\n",
    "- `DefaultDict`, used as `DefaultDict[key_type, value_type]`, a generic variant of `collections.defaultdict`.\n",
    "- `List`, used as `List[element_type]`.\n",
    "- `Set`, used as `Set[element_type]`. See remark for `AbstractSet` below.\n",
    "- `FrozenSet`, used as `FrozenSet[element_type]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `Dict`, `DefaultDict`, `List`, `Set` and `FrozenSet` are mainly useful for annotating return values. For arguments, prefer the abstract collection types defined below, e.g. `Mapping`, `Sequence` or `AbstractSet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Generic` variants of container ABCs (and a few non-containers):\n",
    "- `Awaitable`.\n",
    "- `AsyncIterable`.\n",
    "- `AsyncIterator`.\n",
    "- `ByteString`.\n",
    "- `Callable` (see above, listed here for completeness).\n",
    "- `Collection`.\n",
    "- `Container`.\n",
    "- `ContextManager`.\n",
    "- `Coroutine`.\n",
    "- `Generator`, used as `Generator[yield_type, send_type, return_type]`. This represents the return value of generator functions. It is a subtype of `Iterable` and it has additional type variables for the type accepted by the `send()` method (it is contravariant in this variable – a generator that accepts sending it `Employee` instance is valid in a context where a generator is required that accepts sending it `Manager` instances) and the return type of the generator.\n",
    "- `Hashable` (not generic, but present for completeness).\n",
    "- `ItemsView`.\n",
    "- `Iterable`.\n",
    "- `Iterator`.\n",
    "- `KeysView`.\n",
    "- `Mapping`.\n",
    "- `MappingView`.\n",
    "- `MutableMapping`.\n",
    "- `MutableSequence`.\n",
    "- `MutableSet`.\n",
    "- `Sequence`.\n",
    "- `Set`, renamed to `AbstractSet`. This name change was required because `Set` in the typing module means `set()` with generics.\n",
    "- `Sized` (not generic, but present for completeness).\n",
    "- `ValuesView`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single special methods\n",
    "A few one-off types are defined that test for single special methods (similar to `Hashable` or `Sized`):\n",
    "- `Reversible`, to test for `__reversed__`.\n",
    "- `SupportsAbs`, to test for `__abs__`.\n",
    "- `SupportsComplex`, to test for `__complex__`.\n",
    "- `SupportsFloat`, to test for `__float__`.\n",
    "- `SupportsInt`, to test for `__int__`.\n",
    "- `SupportsRound`, to test for `__round__`.\n",
    "- `SupportsBytes`, to test for `__bytes__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convenience definitions:\n",
    "- `Optional`, defined by `Optional[t] == Union[t, None]`.\n",
    "- `Text`, a simple alias for `str` in Python 3, for unicode in Python 2.\n",
    "- `AnyStr`, defined as `TypeVar('AnyStr', Text, bytes)`.\n",
    "- `NamedTuple`, used as `NamedTuple(type_name, [(field_name, field_type), ...])` and equivalent to collections.`namedtuple(type_name, [field_name, ...])`. This is useful to declare the types of the fields of a named tuple type.\n",
    "- `NewType`, used to create unique types with little runtime overhead `UserId = NewType('UserId', int)`.\n",
    "- `cast()`, described below.\n",
    "- `no_type_check`, a decorator to disable type checking per class or function (see below).\n",
    "- `no_type_check_decorator`, a decorator to create your own decorators with the same meaning as `@no_type_check` (see below).\n",
    "- `type_check_only`, a decorator only available during type checking for use in stub files (see above); marks a class or function as unavailable during runtime.\n",
    "- `overload`, described earlier.\n",
    "- `get_type_hints()`, a utility function to retrieve the type hints from a function or method. Given a function or method object, it returns a dict with the same format as `__annotations__`, but evaluating forward references (which are given as string literals) as expressions in the context of the original function or method definition.\n",
    "- `TYPE_CHECKING`, `False` at runtime but `True` to type checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I/O related types:\n",
    "- `IO` (generic over `AnyStr`).\n",
    "- `BinaryIO` (a simple subtype of `IO[bytes]`).\n",
    "- `TextIO` (a simple subtype of `IO[str]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions and the `re` module\n",
    "Types related to regular expressions and the re module:\n",
    "- `Match` and `Pattern`, types of `re.match()` and `re.compile()` results (generic over `AnyStr`)."
